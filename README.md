Some things to note before submitting a pull request:

- Make sure you always use Carbon.injector() for retrieving references to new blocks, materials, and items
- Make sure all the code you submit is compliant with Java 6
- Make sure all dependencies added have an appropriate Maven repository in the pom.xml.
- Only submit the source code, pom.xml, and plugin-related resources to the repository.
- Do not submit a pull-request for very minor changes. Ex: Spelling, spacing, etc. You may submit a pull request that changes many files at once for spelling and spacing.
- Please use all proper Java conventions Ex: No capitalized fields unless constant, no capitalized methods, etc...
